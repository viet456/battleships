* **Game Logic:** Robust JavaScript logic to handle ship placement, attack validation, hit/miss detection, and game-ending conditions.
* **AI Opponent:** A basic AI opponent provides a single-player challenge.
* **Testing:** Built with a strong emphasis on Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Vite:** Used as the bundler and development server for a fast and efficient workflow.
* **Vitest:** For unit testing, to ensure code quality and correctness.
* **ESLint:** For maintaining code consistency and quality standards.
